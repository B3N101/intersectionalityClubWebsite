		<h1>Who are we?</h1>
		<p>
			Founded in 2022, Intersectionality Club is a student-led organization
			based in Middlesex School, Concord. The club hosts periodic meetings to
			facilitate conversations about various issues and their correlations to
			identity and experience, with the goal of providing a more nuanced outlook
			on said issues. Part of our efforts include the Intersectionality Club
			Column, published monthly both online and in Middlesex School’s newspaper
			the Anvil, and our online publication Prism, with biannual issue releases.
		</p>

		<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
		<p>
			Intersectionality Club aims to provide a nuanced lens through which one
			may analyze issues correlating to identity and experience. By providing an
			educational space where participants may engage, share, and learn, we
			strive to spread awareness of the concept of intersectionality and its
			impact on communities and individuals alike. In particular, the club seeks
			to uplift and amplify historically excluded groups by pushing for
			diversity, equity, and inclusion in both large and small communities
			alike. Apart from working within Middlesex, it is the club’s goal to help
			communities disadvantaged by their intersecting identities globally.
		</p>

		<h1>What is Intersectionality?</h1>
		<p>
			Intersectionality is an analytical framework that recognizes the impact of
			overlapping identities on individuals’ experiences. It takes into account
			the nuance of these experiences, especially in regards to discrimination
			predominantly based on race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, gender
			identity, sexual orientation, ability, religion, age, weight, physical
			appearance, and more. Because of the combined effects of these identities,
			individuals must confront different degrees of oppression and privilege in
			their lives. However, it is important to note that intersectionality is
			not just about oppression and privilege; it encompasses everything in an
			individual’s identity that makes them who they are.
			<br />
			The idea of intersectionality has long been in existence, but the term was
			not officially coined until 1989, when scholar and black feminist Kimberlé
			Crenshaw pointed out the varying forms of discrimination individuals with overlapping
			identities faced.
