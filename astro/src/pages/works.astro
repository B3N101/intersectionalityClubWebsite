		<p class="text-lg text-justify">
			<strong class="text-xl text-blue-600">PRISM</strong> is Intersectionality Club’s online publication consisting
			of student works on identity and experience. This publication acts as a platform
			for the amplification of diverse voices, and as a medium through which students
			can share their individual stories.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg text-justify mt-2">
			We decided on the name Prism because we believe such an object reflects the
			fundamental concept of intersectionality. Just as the unique qualities of a
			prism come from its overlap of colors within, every individual’s identities
			and experiences intersect and affect their story. The name is also inspired
			by civil rights advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw’s quote that intersectionality is
			a "prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate
			together and exacerbate each other.”

		<p class="text-lg text-justify">
			We recognize that identities intersect and are fundamentally
			interconnected, making every individual different in their own unique way.
			We would like to highlight individual experiences and provide an online
			platform with which everyone can share their voices, opinions, and
			perspectives. In order to make using this platform a comfortable
			experience for everyone, here are the guidelines for submission:
			<ol class="indent-4 text-base">
				<li>
					Submissions may take any form: painting, photography, short films,
					personal narrative, poetry, journalistic articles, etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					For writing pieces, you may use first person, because it is your own
					narrative!
				</li>
				<li>
					Word limit: Literary works should not exceed the 3000 word limit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do not appropriate content that is not yours. In other words, use your
					own experience and ideas rather than resorting to plagiarism.
				</li>
				<li>
					Give your piece a title---it will draw the attention of the
					reader/viewer!
				</li>
				<li>
					If you choose to remain anonymous, please let the editors know your
					preference.
				</li>
			</ol>
