							About the publication
						</h1>
						<p class="text-lg text-justify">
							<strong class="text-xl text-blue-600">PRISM</strong> is
							Intersectionality Club’s online publication consisting of student
							works on identity and experience. This publication acts as a
							platform for the amplification of diverse voices, and as a medium
							through which students can share their individual stories.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg text-justify mt-2">
							We decided on the name Prism because we believe such an object
							reflects the fundamental concept of intersectionality. Just as the
							unique qualities of a prism come from its overlap of colors
							within, every individual’s identities and experiences intersect
							and affect their story. The name is also inspired by civil rights
							advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw’s quote that intersectionality is a
							"prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality
							often operate together and exacerbate each other.”
						</p>

						<h1 class="text-4xl text-red-600 font-black py-2">
							Submission Guidelines
						</h1>
						<p class="text-lg text-justify">
							We recognize that identities intersect and are fundamentally
							interconnected, making every individual different in their own
							unique way. We would like to highlight individual experiences and
							provide an online platform with which everyone can share their
							voices, opinions, and perspectives. In order to make using this
							platform a comfortable experience for everyone, here are the
							guidelines for submission:
							<ol class="indent-4 text-base">
								<li>
									Submissions may take any form: painting, photography, short
									films, personal narrative, poetry, journalistic articles, etc.
								</li>
								<li>
									For writing pieces, you may use first person, because it is
									your own narrative!
								</li>
								<li>
									Word limit: Literary works should not exceed the 3000 word
									limit.
								</li>
								<li>
									Do not appropriate content that is not yours. In other words,
									use your own experience and ideas rather than resorting to
									plagiarism.
								</li>
								<li>
									Give your piece a title---it will draw the attention of the
									reader/viewer!
								</li>
								<li>
									If you choose to remain anonymous, please let the editors know
									your preference.

				 Land of “this land is not your land” and shoved into subways at a

				 Land of go back to your country, you do not belong here, you foreign

				11:54pm<br />
				<br />
				 it starts off as a hum &ndash; a low, reverberating purr at the base of
				the throat &ndash; before it snaps, rubber-band like, and roars so
				loudly it pierces through her ears and straight into her head. then, as
				abruptly as it started, it stops, and the engine rumbles away into the
				night.<br />
				<br />
				 the doppler effect, she remembers dimly. an image of a hand-drawn car
				with penciled rings flaring out around it flashes behind her closed
				eyelids. that stupid physics concept we learned last lesson where the
				car is moving towards you&#8230; then away&#8230; and the observed
				frequency increases while the object&rsquo;s sound frequency remains
				constant or something. the car on the paper expands and morphs into a
				plane, then a bird, then a boat, and she's long gone, floating among
				light waves and gravity and convoluted little equations.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				 12:32am<br />
				<br />
				 the melody hasn&rsquo;t stopped. the melody doesn&rsquo;t stop. i have
				an exam tomorrow, she pleads with it. they reply with crescendoing waves
				and cascading thunder. the storm spreads to her feet and she feels the
				familiar, numb tingling, like ants biting into her calves and thighs and
				she just needs to move. so she moves to hold the storm at bay. she
				tosses and turns on the bed as it bobs atop roiling waves. <br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				 07:30am<br />
				<br />
				 Nobody&rsquo;s there yet. Of course nobody is &mdash; she always makes
				sure to wake half an hour before schedule, to be at school half an hour
				before classes start, just in case. She&rsquo;s meticulously checked
				every item in her bag, thrice, just in case. <br />
				<br />
				 Red, raw bite marks dapple her lips, and her nails are chipped and
				jagged. The clock ticks. She tugs at her eyelashes. It&rsquo;s the dread
				that keeps her on the edge of her seat &mdash; the dread that&rsquo;s at
				the tip of her tongue, at the edge of the precipice, teetering, waiting
				to crash over her. What are you so afraid of? She asks herself. She
				doesn&rsquo;t answer. She doesn&rsquo;t know. All she knows is the rain
				pounding away in her head, wahlah-wahlah-wahlah, and that familiar
				sensation of the screw wounding up in her chest. She clutches the phone
				in her hand so tightly her knuckles turn bone-white. Just in case.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				 3:34pm<br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;90. i got a 90.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 i mean, really, what&rsquo;d she expect? she&rsquo;d barely studied for
				this test. actually, she had. she&rsquo;d studied so, so hard, starting
				when the clock struck twelve until the first streaks of daylight
				filtered through the blinds, but she had just been so tired. the
				rustling leaves had thundered in her temples for hours straight, and
				she&rsquo;d felt like she was bobbing up and down on driftwood, with
				crackling static blaring in her ears. <br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s wonderful! well done!&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 he&rsquo;s a nosy man with red-framed glasses and a clipboard in his
				hands. he&rsquo;s nosy because all he does is pry and pry and pry, in
				order to fill the empty space gaping in his own life. he doesn&rsquo;t
				get it. <br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not that good of a result.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 she fiddles absentmindedly with the grass seahorse in her hands.
				there&rsquo;s a small dip in between the snout and the neck that she
				likes, because the rasp &mdash; the shkk &mdash; feels particularly good
				against the pad of her thumb. shkk. shkk. shkk.<br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;i think you're a little too hard on yourself sometimes, but i
				assure you that you are perfectly fine. an average person doesn&rsquo;t
				do as well as you do. in fact, you are gifted!&rdquo; he laughs as if
				he&rsquo;s said something particularly clever. &ldquo;so you see, you
				have nothing to worry about.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;okay.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 shkk. shkk.<br />
				<br />
				 he slides a thin stack of documents across the table towards her.
				&ldquo;here are your results from last week. you can take a look when
				you have time.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 she doesn&rsquo;t want to wait, though, because nausea is rising up in
				her throat and threatening to crush her chest in its fist. she snatches
				the papers, and the first thing that pops up in her vision &mdash; the
				one bolded, italicized, underlined word, right smack at the bottom of
				the documents &mdash;<br />
				<br />
				 ineligible.<br />
				<br />
				 she laughs. then she laughs again. then she laughs harder and doubles
				over. she doesn&rsquo;t care that she&rsquo;s in this strange,
				marble-tiled room with fluorescent lights beaming down on her and a
				stranger sitting across the table from her. she doesn&rsquo;t care that
				the stranger is currently gazing at her with some sort of paternalistic,
				patronizing concern in his eyes.<br />
				<br />
				 she straightens up.<br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;thanks for the diagnosis, dr. verdi,&rdquo; she tells him,
				&ldquo;i know you tried.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				 4:19pm<br />
				<br />
				 He meets her by the pond next to the woods next to the school.
				It&rsquo;s a good distance away &mdash; close enough to be convenient,
				yet far enough so that stragglers heading home at dusk don&rsquo;t
				stumble upon them. The same figure, the same pond, the same posture,
				every Thursday. Strangely enough, his still form reminds her of that
				series of 25 paintings some artist did of haystacks, each painting
				differing by just the slightest change in mood or in lighting or in
				shadows. The only constant thing in those paintings are the haystacks,
				which stay exactly the same across every canvas; they just squat there
				amongst the rustling fields, stoically, tauntingly, almost like they
				want to piss her off with their stillness.<br />
				<br />
				 Anyway. There he stands, a hooded figure silhouetted against a
				whispering backdrop. He&rsquo;s nervous. She can tell. His eyes &mdash;
				round, gray, owl-like eyes that peek out from behind thick-framed
				glasses &mdash; dart from left to right to left again before finally
				landing on her.<br />
				<br />
				 &ldquo;Dude, my mom caught me sneaking out and made me tell her what I
				was doing,&rdquo; is the first thing he says when she nears.
				&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m a good liar.&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 She doesn&rsquo;t respond. Maybe she doesn&rsquo;t have the will to.
				The rustling of the trees is crescendoing, somehow, cluttering her ears,
				extending directly through her temples and into her brain and her eyes
				and her nose and hemming in on her, and she&rsquo;s getting really
				annoyed. <br />
				<br />
				 Noticing the long lapse of silence, he shifts uncomfortably, kicking at
				the pebbles near his feet. &ldquo;Um. So. Are they helping?&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 Yes. No. Kind of. But she doesn&rsquo;t say any of this out loud
				because the rustling is overwhelming, and she just wants him to shut up.
				So she nods and schools her features into a smile. Maybe it looks more
				like a grimace &mdash; she hopes it doesn&rsquo;t. Either way, relief
				slackens his face. &ldquo;Okay. That&rsquo;s good. Just be careful of
				the side effects, okay? You&rsquo;re going to tell me if you start
				feeling any, right?&rdquo;<br />
				<br />
				 She barely registers what he&rsquo;s saying, but she nods again anyway.
				She extends her hand, palm up, and he drops the bottle in her hand. He
				waves to her, she waves to him; he turns and walks north, she turns and
				heads south. Two strangers finding their way home.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				 8:44pm<br />
				<br />
				 she kicks the week-old ramen cup out of the way and watches it skid
				across the room, trembling fingers fumbling with the lock; back pressed
				against the door, she slides down until her knees hit the ground and
				rests her cheek against the cool stone wall, crushed to the floor by a
				suffocating weight.<br />
				<br />
				 not this again.<br />
				<br />
				 dazedly, she tries to calm her mind, but the waterfall crashes down
				again, drowning all coherent thought in a raging torrent. she opens her
				mouth, tries to speak to herself, and all that escapes is a muffled
				choke that grows into a whine. her hands push into her hair and she
				tugs, and tugs, but even the pinpricks of pain that jab into her skull
				don&rsquo;t snap her out of it. <br />
				<br />
				 her unfocused eyes slide around the room until they zero in on a gray,
				tattered tapestry that&rsquo;s dangling from the wall. the cord that
				ties it to the wall is fraying, unraveling, and something about that
				casual, sluggish destruction pushes her over the edge. with two steps,
				she&rsquo;s across the room &mdash; she wrenches it off, she enjoys the
				snap it makes as it tears &mdash; then she&rsquo;s ripping the intricate
				fabric work up with her hands, glistening beads are clattering to the
				floor like a cascade of iridescent hail and they hurt just like actual
				hail too, pinging off her feet and her hands until she finally hurls the
				tapestry away from her with all the force she can muster. it falls to
				the floor and flutters there, brokenly, until she stomps on it. it goes
				still.<br />
				<br />
				 her blood is roaring red in her eyes, heartbeat churning in her ears,
				when she starts to smile. she laughs out loud, but it&rsquo;s a quiet
				laugh, like a giggle to herself more than anything.<br />
				<br />
				 she has never been a big believer in destiny, but right now, she
				realizes that some people are just born with lucky fates. others,
				though, aren&rsquo;t so fortunate. others are born incompetent &mdash;
				abnomal &mdash; destined to spend their lives catching up to the lucky
				ones and failing. and maybe she&rsquo;s just being melodramatic. maybe
				she&rsquo;s just overthinking, as usual, and she should learn to be more
				optimistic, and positive, and smiley, and just smile more and just bear
				it and just smile more just bear it.<br />
				<br />
				 something nudges against her foot, and when she looks down, she
				realizes it&rsquo;s the bottle the boy gave her this afternoon.<br />
				<br />
				 it&rsquo;s one of those generic see-through orange ones with a
				screwed-on white cap. she bends down and picks it up; the blue pills
				rattle as she curls her fingers around the bottle, the sound
				reverberating through her chest like a dying breath. already she can
				feel the dread settling, closing in on her lungs and threatening to
				crush her heart into a pulp. <br />
				<br />
				 she recalls the question he asked. &ldquo;are they helping?&rdquo;<br
				/>
				<br />
				 she&#8230; doesn&rsquo;t know. she thinks they&rsquo;re helping. she
				thinks. at least she&rsquo;s been focusing better recently. the lunch
				queue gives her less headaches. her mom doesn&rsquo;t ask her why she
				can&rsquo;t be as good as her brother as often, and her friends
				haven&rsquo;t given her that &ldquo;you&rsquo;re fucking stupid&rdquo;
				look in two weeks. the drowning sensation feels less like a sea and more
				like a river.<br />
				<br />
				 the noise is quieter. the waves are quieter.<br />
				<br />
				 but she hadn&rsquo;t wanted to tell him about the awful throbbing in
				her chest that comes with the quiet.<br />
				<br />
				 she pops the lid off. slides a pill onto her tongue and swallows. <br
				/>
				<br />
				 waits. waits. waits.<br />
				<br />
				 waits.<br />
				<br />
				 waits. <br />
				<br />
				 she <br />
				<br />
				 waits.<br />
				<br />
				 she<br />
				<br />
				 welcomes the familiar weight as it settles into her chest. <br />
				<br />
				 for one still moment of clarity,<br />
				<br />
				 the waves hush<br />

				The Art of Language by Mahika Varma
			</h1>
			<p class="text-base">
				Most people go through their lives wishing they learned another
				language. This stems from many things, like interest in a television
				show, such as Japanese in Alice in Borderland, or increasing
				employability, like French in Canada. Wanting to know a language other
				than English is common because most feel that English is plain and
				uninteresting. Everyone knows English, right?<br />
				<br />
				 I often hear: &ldquo;You know French? That is crazy!&rdquo; and I
				appreciate the admiration, but I notice that this is not the reaction I
				receive when someone finds out I speak Hindi. I am expected to know
				Hindi, just like you are expected to speak English, and it is,
				therefore, unimpressive. Never mind I was born in Canada and went to an
				English-speaking school. Never mind I had to learn Hindi for six hours
				every Saturday. It is just not impressive.<br />
				<br />
				 People often forget that understanding any language is a feat because
				they are so enamoured with Western European dialects. When a French
				immigrant knows French, they are treated like a God. When a British
				immigrant has an accent, they become rather popular. This is not to say
				the French should be demeaned, or that we should disregard the
				fascinating accent of the British, but we must recognize our own
				hypocrisy. When a Mexican immigrant speaks Spanish, or a Chinese
				immigrant speaks accented English, we, as a society, treat them
				differently. Now, our gut reaction may be to deny this, but it is true.<br
				/><br />
				 In 2018, the Pew Research Center found that 38% of Hispanic or Latino
				people in America &ldquo;have recently experienced one of four incidents
				&ndash; being called offensive names, being told to go back to their
				home country, being criticized for speaking Spanish in public, or
				experiencing discrimination or unfair treatment because they are
				Hispanic&rdquo; (Lopez et al., 2018). Similarly, The University of
				Queensland found that in the hiring process, there was no discrimination
				between a candidate with American-accented English versus
				British-accented English, but there was heavy prejudice in favour of
				candidates with American-accented English over those with
				Chinese-accented English (Spence, et al., 2022). Evidently, the
				qualifications of these candidates did not play a role in the judgements
				made about them. Speaking Chinese-accented English simply implied that
				the candidate was uneducated and not fit for the job, whereas speaking
				British-accented English did not hinder an applicant&rsquo;s chances.<br
				/><br />
				 Why is it that we hate &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;-accented English so much?
				Some argue that it is hard to understand, and others argue that if
				someone has immigrated, they may have less education, but neither of
				these assertions makes much sense. That is, of course, logically
				speaking, but much prejudice is not based on logic, but on assumptions
				that are made about certain groups. When someone speaks with
				accented-English, a picture of stereotypes will pop into our heads,
				whether that be intentional or otherwise. Perhaps when we hear a British
				accent, we think of royalty and education because of the monarchy and
				riches. On the other hand, perhaps when we hear an Indian accent, we
				think of corruption and dirt, because last week we saw a news piece on
				CNN about the Indian government&rsquo;s faults. These images and
				stereotypes paint severely different pictures of these two groups and
				systemically hinder their chances for success.<br /><br />
				 So, what does this tell us? The problem is not that someone speaks a
				different language, or someone has a different accent. It is that
				someone speaks a language or has an accent with which we do not feel
				comfortable. To combat this implicit bias, systemic changes must be
				made, which is not an easy task, but accepting and identifying the issue
				is the first step. <br />

				Dear Diary (anonymous)
			</h1>
			<p class="text-base">
				Dear diary, The sun&rsquo;s already up&mdash;when did it get so bright?<br
				/>
				 The light&rsquo;s pouring across the pillows&mdash;the shadows are hazy
				and grey.<br />
				 It&rsquo;s dawn and my clothes are getting tighter. My jeans are above
				my ankles and my<br />
				 shirts are strained around my arms.<br />
				 I&rsquo;m sticky&mdash;it&rsquo;s humid and the fan&rsquo;s blowing my
				hair into my mouth, and I can feel<br />
				 the sweat down the nape of my neck, and my skin feels tight and my lips
				are<br />
				 chapped, and it&rsquo;s weird because<br />
				 I can&rsquo;t fit into the nook between my bed and my wall
				anymore&mdash;<br />
				 I&rsquo;m growing up, and I&rsquo;m scared, and I need to think and
				plan and write and work<br />
				 and<br />
				 I&rsquo;m too young, I don&rsquo;t know enough&mdash;you said it
				yourself.<br />
				 So why do I have to decide when I never had to before&mdash;<br />
				 It&rsquo;s been a nice summer, I guess. I haven&rsquo;t been back to
				school in half a year.<br />
				 I&rsquo;m going back soon though, but I like it here, in my room,
				watching the sun rise<br />
				 and the morning creep over the rooftops.<br />
				 I miss it more than I can remember it.<br />
				 I&rsquo;m back in school now&mdash;<br />
				 Everything&rsquo;s passing by so quickly, so I haven&rsquo;t thought
				much about home<br />
				 What if I change so much it doesn&rsquo;t feel like home anymore and
				what if I&rsquo;m gone<br />
				 for so long my friends don&rsquo;t remember how we used to be&mdash;<br
				/>
				 I want everything to stay the way it is. Was.<br />
				 I&rsquo;m probably failing though&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t texted them in
				weeks.<br />
				 I want to scream&mdash;it&rsquo;s just like that lyric&mdash;atop of
				every roof in the city of my heart?<br />
				 Except I&rsquo;m not in a city. I&rsquo;m in this stupid town and it
				feels like my heart&rsquo;s hitting<br />
				 the ground and the birds are screeching and my blanket&rsquo;s falling
				off and I&rsquo;m tired<br />
				 I&rsquo;m tired I&rsquo;m so tired<br />
				 I want more I want to feel more I want to be more&mdash;<br />
				 Dear Diary, the curtain&rsquo;s slicing a stripe of the sun right into
				my eyes.<br />
				 Dear Diary, it&rsquo;s 6:32am. I don&rsquo;t want my friends to leave
				me, I don&rsquo;t want to leave<br />
				 my friends, I want to go home but I don&rsquo;t know where that is
				anymore and I don&rsquo;t<br />
				 want anything to change and I want everything to change but I want to
				be better<br />
				 this time; Dear Ddiary I feel like I&rsquo;m being ripped apart,<br />
				 Dear Diary, I want to rip out the sections of my life&mdash;the past
				the present the<br />
				 future&mdash;and rearrange them so that they make sense to me;<br />
				 When did summer end, when will summer begin?<br />
				 When will I ever be control, can someone take this control away from me
				please,<br />
				 so it cannot be my fault<br />
				 Dear Diary, I&rsquo;m all grown up now&mdash;and I hate it more than I
				can explain it.<br />

				Cantonese by Audrey Tang
			</h1>
			<p class="text-base">
				Loud, crass, lively, flip-flopping off the tongue. There are nine tones.
				Nine subtle fluctuations of the tongue and the throat as the old women
				at the wet market argue like their lives depend on the price of a trout.
				The bickering escalates. Well, that&rsquo;s not pretty. I try to do the
				opposite of focus &mdash; I stop concentrating, I try to disassociate my
				memory from my hearing &mdash; and for just one moment, the
				women&rsquo;s voices sound like jabbering chaos. <br />
				<br />
				 Unlike Italian, Cantonese does not flow through the ears like water.
				Unlike French, it does not soothe like aloe on sun-scarred skin. But the
				familiar up-down-right-left bounce of the dialect makes me laugh. In no
				other language will you find the casual, incomprehensible vulgarity with
				which we Hong Kongers speak. <br />
				<br />
				 But there is beauty in the words. Our names hold meaning and love. Mine
				means blue sky. To be free like a bird in the blue skies. To remain
				sturdy and unyielding like a pilot in the blue skies. To be joyful and
				cloudless and forever full of sunlight in the blue skies.<br /><br />

				 Talking in Cantonese is how you should sing, my vocal teacher sometimes
				says. Always going, never stopping, sometimes boisterous, sometimes subdued,
				but never breaking the line. The legato. Because no matter how staccato Cantonese
				sounds, the words form steady rivulets, just like how a breath is constantly
				sustained, how a soft palate is continuously lifted. There must be tension
				between the palate and the back of the tongue. Just like in Cantonese. So,
				Cantonese is singing.<br /><br />

				 Cantonese is when your father yells at the TV about the state of the economy.
				Cantonese is your grandmother lecturing you over a round of mahjong and dinners.
				It is chattering to your mother about the effects of the patriarchy in Asian
				families. It is memorizing and reading the most heartrending poetry in classrooms
				while your teacher teaches you about the romanticism of Li Bai or Du Mu.
				It is also cursing with the filthiest words known to civilization in the
				railway station while knowing nobody will bat an eye.<br /><br />

				 I latch onto Cantonese tightly during winters and summers.
